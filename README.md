# expjava
Experiments in java while I learn it. My first few projects will be to replicate the ones I did in python.
## NumberGuess
Enter a minimum and a maximum. Then try to get the number between the two numbers. Same as python numberguess.
## PygLatin
Translate english words to pyglatin. Not much else to say. Same as python pyglatintranslator.
