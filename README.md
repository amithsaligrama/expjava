# expjava
Experiments in java while I learn it. My first few projects will be to replicate the ones I did in python.
## NumberGuess
Enter a minimum and a maximum. Then try to get the number between the two numbers. Same as python numberguess.
## PygLatin
Translate english words to pyglatin. Same as python pyglatintranslator.
## NRemover
Removes all n's in the string you give it. Same as python N_Remover. As for the joke at the end, that's for you to figure out!
## MessageEncryptor
Encrypts your message however you want. Same as python lettereplacer but taken to the next level.
## BinaryConverter
